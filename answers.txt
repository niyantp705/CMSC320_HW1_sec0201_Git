Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is the industry-standard version control system for managing projects, tracking changes, and facilitating collaboration. Git saves a complete history of all the changes made to a project. This also works as a safety net in case the user may need to revert to a previous version. The platform lets multiple people contribute to the same files simultaneously without overwriting each other's progress. Furthermore, its more powerful feature is branching, which allows developers to work on new features or bug fixes in a safe, isolated environment without affecting the main project. Once completed, those branches can be cleanly merged back.


Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to virtually all fields, from retail to astronomy. A prominent example is its application in healthcare, where data scientists can utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze vast datasets of patient records, genetic information, and medical images to predict disease outbreaks and patient risks.


Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: The main difference between merging and rebasing is how they integrate changes from one branch into another: merging combines histories, while rebasing rewrites history.

In a merge, Git takes the commits from a feature branch and a main branch and combines them. This creates a special new "merge commit" in the main branch that ties the two histories together. The original history of the feature branch remains$

Rebasing, on the other hand, moves the entire feature branch to begin on the tip of the main branch. It works by taking all the commits from your feature branch, one by one, and re-applying them on top of main's latest commit. This process re$


Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: As a student in CMSC320 this semester, I'm genuinely looking forward to building a strong, practical foundation in data science. I'm excited to move beyond theoretical concepts and gain hands-on proficiency with the essential skills a$
